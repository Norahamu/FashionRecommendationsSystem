## Motivation
The fashion industry is a rapidly growing sector where visual representation of products plays a crucial role in consumer decision-making. We chose this dataset because it contains a diverse set of fashion product images along with their attributes, making it useful for various applications such as image classification, recommendation systems, and visual search. This dataset is valuable for research and development in AI-driven fashion solutions.

## We chose this dataset because the fashion industry heavily relies on visual representation, and AI-driven solutions like image classification and recommendation systems can enhance user experience. This dataset provides a diverse set of fashion product images with metadata, making it ideal for developing machine learning models for fashion analytics, classification, and visual search.

## Dataset Overview
The Fashion Product Images Dataset consists of images of fashion products with metadata, including product categories, gender specifications, and other attributes. The dataset is useful for training machine learning models for fashion item classification and recommendation systems.

### Key Features:
- **Product Images**: A large collection of fashion product images.
- **Metadata**: Each image is labeled with attributes such as category, sub-category, gender, season, and usage.
- **Structured Data**: Includes CSV files containing image paths and their corresponding metadata.
- **Potential Use Cases**: Image classification, and recommendation systems.

## Dataset Source
The dataset is available on Kaggle:

## Analysis & Preprocessing Steps
The Jupyter Notebook in this repository includes the following steps:

- **Data Loading & Exploration**:
   - Importing the dataset and examining its structure.
   - Checking the distribution of categories, subcategories, labels and gender.

- **Data Visualization**:
   - Displaying sample images from the dataset.
   - Visualizing category distributions using bar charts.
   
- **Missing Value Analysis & Handling**:
   - Identifying missing values and handling them appropriately.
   - Dropping unnecessary columns or filling missing values.

- **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Converting categorical labels into numerical format.
   - Normalizing image paths for easy accessibility.
   - Splitting data for training and testing purposes.
